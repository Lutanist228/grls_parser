# grls_parser
This script is in charge of saving the information about certain drug. It puts the characteristics - trade_name, company_name, country, dosage_form, dosage and others - into the tables and saves the tables in database via SQLite instruments. To work correctly the script must extract The International Nonproprietary Name from the script  "mnn_dict_res.py". Once the raw data is being put into the table, it must overcome additional SQL processing. I use SQL queries to success with the final processing.
